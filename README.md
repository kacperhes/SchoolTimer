<b>#About</b>

This is probably first ring to ring timer for student as android app.
I know the code isn`t very good, but it`s my 3rd project as android app(no previous experiance in other language or any commerial experiance).
I challanged myself to write at least 1 line of code(comments included) every day.
I`m planning to start a blog where I will write something more about that project.

<b>#Downloads</b>

I will release it into Google Play when it will be prepared as fully functional app.

<b>#Contribute</b>

If you would like to change/add sth, you can, but please comment as much as you can. People prefers writing code, than trying to read it.
