<b>#About</b>

This is probably first ring to ring timer for student as android app.
I know the code isn`t very good, but it`s my 3rd project as android app(no previous experiance in other language or any commerial experiance, other projects are simpler).
I challanged myself to write at least 1 line of code(comments included) every day.
I`m planning to start a blog where I will write something more about that project.

<b>#Downloads</b>

I will release it into Google Play when it will be prepared as fully functional app.
